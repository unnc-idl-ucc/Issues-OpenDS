There is no callable cornering lamp trigger method in OpenDS framework. Therefore, it is difficult to implement the cornering lamp trigger.


    
#### 2. Automatically adapting speed in auto-pilot scenarios
When user want to change the speed in auto-pilot scenarios, all of the speed, trigger coordinates in XML files will changed. The current OpenDS framework couldn't support this function.
